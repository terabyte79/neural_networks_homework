# neural_networks_homework

The purpose of this assignment is to create a model that predicts whether applicants/startups will be successful when funded by a venture capital firm.

We are provided with data for over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from the venture capital firm over the years.

We will develop a binary classifier model to predict the success of an applicant as a business. The CSV file contains various information about these businesses, including their eventual success.

#### Primary Tasks

* Prepare the data for utilization in a neural network model.
* Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
* Optimize the neural network model.
